'''
    Driver for a Swabian PulseStreamer 8/2
    D.Mark - Jun 2023
    Added additional base capabilities as listed in the API documentation (see below). Use as you wish, be chaotic.

    C.Egerstrom - Mar 2023
    De-lantz-ed version of Nazar's old driver. Use as you wish, be evil.

    N.Delegan - Sep 2020.
    Use as you wish, be nice.

    :to-do:
    De-jank init so multiple PSs doesn't break it

    leans heavily into API info at https://www.swabianinstruments.com/static/documentation/PulseStreamer/sections/api-doc.html
